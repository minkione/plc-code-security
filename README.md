Experiments with the [Top 20 Secure PLC Coding Practices](https://plc-security.com)

Materials from our talks/workshops on the topic:
- [ICSJWG 2022 spring meeting](icsjwg2022)
- [DEFCON 30 workshop](dc30)
- [BruCON 0x0E workshop](brucon0x0E)

Contains both PLC code for [soMachineBasic](https://xsl.se.com/public/) (now *EcoStructure Machine Expert Basic*) as well as the corresponding SCADA projects for [Schneider IGSS](https://igss.schneider-electric.com/)

The process simulation used during the workshop is available at [https://github.com/arnaudsoullie/simple-process-simulation](https://github.com/arnaudsoullie/simple-process-simulation)
